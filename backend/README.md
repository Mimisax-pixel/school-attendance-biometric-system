# ðŸ“š School Attendance Biometric System API

## Overview
This project provides a robust backend API for a school attendance biometric system, built with Node.js and Express. It leverages Mongoose for elegant MongoDB object modeling, facilitating secure student registration, authentication, and the groundwork for biometric-based attendance tracking.

## Features
*   **Student Registration**: Seamlessly register new students with comprehensive personal and academic details.
*   **Student Authentication**: Secure student login using matriculation number, email, or phone number, protected by JWT.
*   **Biometric Data Integration**: Stores biometric identifiers for future attendance verification mechanisms.
*   **Flexible Data Model**: Designed with Mongoose schemas for students and classes, allowing for extensible data management.
*   **JWT-based Authorization**: Implements JSON Web Tokens for secure session management and protecting API routes.
*   **CORS Enabled**: Configured to handle cross-origin requests, ensuring frontend integration.
*   **Environment Configuration**: Utilizes `.env` files for secure and flexible environment variable management.

## Getting Started

To get this API up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mimisax-pixel/school-attendance-biometric-system.git
    cd school-attendance-biometric-system/backend
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Navigate into the `backend` directory and install the required Node.js packages.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and configure the necessary variables. An example is provided in the Environment Variables section.

4.  **Start the Server**:
    You can start the server in development mode (with `nodemon` for auto-restarts) or production mode.
    ```bash
    # For development (with hot-reloading)
    npm run dev

    # For production
    npm start
    ```
    The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000` (or your specified `PORT`).

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root of the `backend` directory with the following variables:

| Variable                | Example Value                                  | Description                                           |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`                  | `5000`                                         | The port on which the Express server will run.        |
| `DB_CONNECTION_STRING`  | `mongodb://localhost:27017/school_attendance`  | Connection string for your MongoDB database.          |
| `JWT_SECRET`            | `your_super_secret_jwt_key_here`               | A secret key used to sign and verify JWTs. Keep this secure. |

## Usage
Once the server is running, you can interact with the API using tools like Postman, Insomnia, or by integrating it with a frontend application.

To make requests:

1.  **Start the API** as described in the Installation section.
2.  **Use an API Client** (e.g., Postman) to send HTTP requests to the defined endpoints.
3.  Ensure your requests include the correct headers (e.g., `Content-Type: application/json` for POST requests).

## API Documentation

### Base URL
The base URL for all API endpoints is `http://localhost:[PORT]/api/v1`. Replace `[PORT]` with the port your server is running on (e.g., `5000`).

### Endpoints

#### POST /register/student
Registers a new student in the system.

**Request**:
```json
{
  "fullname": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "jane.doe@example.com",
  "phone": "09012345678",
  "department": "Computer Science",
  "level": "300",
  "matricNumber": "CST/18/0001",
  "biometricData": "fingerprint_hash_data_string",
  "password": "securepassword123" 
}
```
**Note**: `password` is optional and defaults to "password123" if not provided. `biometricData` is also optional and defaults to "biometric_placeholder" if not provided, but it's required by the schema eventually.

**Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "Student registered successfully",
  "student": {
    "fullname": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane.doe@example.com",
    "phone": "09012345678",
    "department": "Computer Science",
    "level": "300",
    "matricNumber": "CST/18/0001",
    "biometricData": "fingerprint_hash_data_string",
    "password": "securepassword123",
    "_id": "65e23f8c8d3e2a001a1b2c3d",
    "attendance": [],
    "createdAt": "2024-03-01T12:00:00.000Z",
    "__v": 0
  }
}
```

**Errors**:
- `400 Bad Request`: Missing required fields (email, phone, department, level, matricNumber), or a student with the provided email, phone, matric number, or biometric data already exists.
- `500 Server Error`: An unexpected server-side error occurred during registration.

#### POST /login/student
Authenticates a student using their matriculation number, email, or phone number, along with their password.

**Request**:
```json
{
  "matricNumber": "CST/18/0001", 
  "password": "securepassword123"
}
```
**Note**: `matricNumber` can be replaced with `email` or `phone` to identify the student.

**Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "Login successful",
  "student": {
    "fullname": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane.doe@example.com",
    "phone": "09012345678",
    "department": "Computer Science",
    "level": "300",
    "matricNumber": "CST/18/0001",
    "biometricData": "fingerprint_hash_data_string",
    "password": "securepassword123",
    "_id": "65e23f8c8d3e2a001a1b2c3d",
    "attendance": [],
    "createdAt": "2024-03-01T12:00:00.000Z",
    "__v": 0
  }
}
```
A `token` cookie containing the JWT will also be set upon successful login.

**Errors**:
- `400 Bad Request`: `matricNumber` (or equivalent identifier) and `password` are required.
- `404 Not Found`: Student not found with the provided identifier.
- `401 Unauthorized`: Invalid password.
- `500 Server Error`: An unexpected server-side error occurred during login.
